# 🚀 PrivatePay Now Supports USDC & USDT Payments

We're excited to announce a major upgrade to PrivatePay! 💳

You can now issue virtual cards using **three payment options**:
- 💜 **SOL** (Solana)
- 🔵 **USDC** (USD Coin)
- 🟢 **USDT** (Tether)

## What This Means for You

✅ **More flexibility** — Pay with your preferred stablecoin or SOL
✅ **Better price stability** — USDC & USDT are 1:1 with USD, no volatility
✅ **Same instant verification** — Automatic blockchain detection for all tokens
✅ **No extra fees** — Same pricing across all payment methods

## How It Works

1. Choose your payment token (SOL, USDC, or USDT)
2. We calculate the exact amount needed
3. Send the payment to your unique wallet address
4. We verify it automatically on Solana
5. Your card is issued instantly ⚡

**Works for:**
- 💳 New card issuance
- 💰 Card top-ups
- 🔄 All funding operations

## Under the Hood

We built robust SPL token verification that:
- Detects USDC & USDT transfers to our payment wallet
- Validates sender's transaction on Solana mainnet
- Applies smart amount matching (tighter tolerances for stablecoins)
- Protects against race conditions & double-spending

All tokens use Solana's Token Program (SPL). Fast, secure, reliable. ✨
